        <p>Cricketer-turned-politician Imran Khan, 71, will not be on this year's ballot, because this time he's the one behind bars during an election, serving a sentence he and his supporters decry as "politically motivated" and "a conspiracy".

            His rise to power - and fall from grace - have both been attributed to the army, despite denials by both parties. His opponents in 2018 accused him of being their proxy, while his supporters allege the army chief is behind his jailing.
            
            Back in 2018, the leader of the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party was portrayed as a change candidate, promising to end dynastic politics, ensure accountability of corrupt politicians, reform the judiciary and create jobs for young people as part of a revamped economy.
            
            But under his rule, the economy collapsed, the cost of living soared, many of his political opponents were jailed, media freedoms were curbed and human rights violations and attacks against journalists increased.
            
            Khan was also widely criticised for giving a nod to signing a peace deal with the Pakistani Taliban that backfired, and for supporting Taliban rule in Afghanistan - not to mention controversial remarks justifying the violence against women in Pakistan and denial of education to girls in Afghanistan.
            
            Some political analysts argue his support has dipped so much in recent years that he would have been defeated if an election had been held (as he called for) in 2023 - prison or no prison.
            
            And yet, a Gallup poll - released in January 2024 - found he was still the most popular politician nationally, though Mr Sharif had closed the gap considerably in the last six months.
            
            There are real concerns the PTI is not being given a fair chance to campaign. Many of its leaders are behind bars or have defected, its candidates are having to stand as independents and others are on the run. The party was also stripped of its cricket bat symbol, essential to help millions of illiterate voters choose where to mark their ballots.
            
            Meanwhile, with just a week to go until the vote, Pakistan's courts handed down two more sentences to Khan, who was already serving three years.</p>

                    all but eliminating any possibility of his return to active politics in the near future. It
                    appears that the country's military establishment expects Khan's political resolve to eventually
                    break down in jail.</p>

                        based on the principles of Islam. The vision is based on three pillars: justice, compassion, and
                        accountability.</p>

                            in the National Assembly in the 2002 general election, serving as an opposition member from
                            Mianwali until 2007.</p>

                    <p>During his victory speech, he laid out the policy outlines for his future government. Khan said
                        his
                        inspiration is to build Pakistan as a humanitarian state based on principles of the first
                        Islamic
                        state of Medina. He described that his future government will put the poor and commoners of the
                        country first and all policies will be geared towards elevating the standards of living of the
                        lesser fortunate. He promised an investigation into rigging allegations. He said that he wanted
                        a
                        united Pakistan and would refrain from victimizing his political opponents. Everyone would be
                        equal
                        under the law. He promised a simple and less costly government, devoid of showy pompousness in
                        which
                        the prime minister's house will be converted into an educational institute and governor houses
                        will
                        be used for public benefit.</p>
